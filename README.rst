Command-line examples
=====================

The easiest way to run reprotest is via our presets::

    # Build the current directory in a null server (/tmp)
    $ reprotest .
    $ reprotest . -vv -- null -d # for very verbose output

    # Build the given Debian source package in an schroot
    # See https://wiki.debian.org/sbuild for instructions on setting that up.
    $ reprotest reprotest_0.3.3.dsc -- schroot unstable-amd64-sbuild

Currently, we only support this for Debian packages, but are keen on
adding more. If we don't have knowledge on how to build your file or
directory, you can send a patch to us on adding this intelligence - see
the reprotest.presets python module, and adapt the existing logic.

In the meantime, you can use other parts of the CLI to build arbitrary things.
You'll need to give two mandatory arguments, the build command to run and the
build artifact file/pattern to test after running the build. For example::

    $ reprotest 'python3 setup.py bdist' 'dist/*.tar.gz'

This runs the command on ``.``, the current working directory. To run it on a
project located elsewhere::

    $ reprotest -s ../path/to/other/project 'python3 setup.py bdist' 'dist/*.tar.gz'
    $ reprotest -c 'python3 setup.py bdist' ../path/to/other/project 'dist/*.tar.gz'

These two invocations are equivalent; you can pick the most convenient one
for your use-case. When using these from a shell:

  * If the build command has spaces, you will need to quote them, e.g.
    ``reprotest "debuild -b -uc -us" [..]``.

  * If you want to use several build artifact patterns, or if you want to
    use shell wildcards as a pattern, you will also need to quote them, e.g.
    ``reprotest [..] "*.tar.gz *.tar.xz"``.

  * If your build artifacts have spaces in their names, you will need to
    quote these twice, e.g. ``'"a file with spaces.gz"'`` for a single
    artifact or ``'"dir 1"/* "dir 2"/*'`` for multiple patterns.

To get more help for the CLI, including documentation on optional
arguments and what they do, run::

    $ reprotest --help


Running in a virtual server
===========================

You can also run the build inside what is called a "virtual server".
This could be a container, a chroot, etc. You run them like this::

    $ reprotest 'python3 setup.py bdist_wheel' 'dist/*.whl' -- qemu    /path/to/qemu.img
    $ reprotest 'debuild -b -uc -us'           '../*.deb'   -- schroot unstable-amd64

There are different server types available. See ``--help`` for a list of
them, which appears near the top, in the "virtual\_server\_args" part of
the "positional arguments" section.

For each virtual server (e.g. "schroot"), you see which extra arguments
it supports::

    $ reprotest --help schroot

When running builds inside a virtual server, you will probably have to
give extra commands, in order to set up your build dependencies inside
the virtual server. For example, to take you through what the "Debian
directory" preset would look like, if we ran it using the full CLI::

    # "Debian directory" preset
    $ reprotest . -- schroot unstable-amd64-sbuild
    # This is exactly equivalent to this:
    $ reprotest -c auto . -- schroot unstable-amd64-sbuild
    # In the non-preset full CLI, this is roughly similar to:
    $ reprotest \
        --testbed-init 'apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install \
                        util-linux disorderfs 2>/dev/null; \
                        test -c /dev/fuse || mknod -m 666 /dev/fuse c 10 229' \
        --build-command 'PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH apt-get -y --no-install-recommends build-dep ./; \
                         dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b' \
        . \
        '../*.deb' \
        -- \
        schroot unstable-amd64-sbuild

The ``--testbed-init`` argument is needed to set up basic tools, which
reprotest needs in order to make the variations in the first place. This
should be the same regardless of what package is being built, but might
differ depending on what virtual\_server is being used.

Next, we have ``--build-command`` (or ``-c``). For our Debian directory, we
install build-dependencies using ``apt-get``, then we run the actual build
command itself using ``dpkg-buildpackage(1)``.

Then, we have the ``source_root`` and the ``artifact_pattern``. For
reproducibility, we're only interested in the binary packages.

Finally, we specify that this is to take place in the "schroot"
virtual\_server with arguments "unstable-amd64-sbuild".

Of course, all of this is a burden to remember, if you must run the same
thing many times. So that is why adding new presets for new files would
be good.

Here is a more complex example. It tells reprotest to store the build products
into ``./artifacts`` to analyse later; and also tweaks the "Debian dsc" preset
so that it uses our `experimental toolchain
<https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/ExperimentalToolchain>`__::

    $ reprotest --store-dir=artifacts \
        --auto-preset-expr '_.prepend.testbed_init("apt-get install -y wget 2>/dev/null; \
            echo deb http://reproducible.alioth.debian.org/debian/ ./ >> /etc/apt/sources.list; \
            wget -q -O- https://reproducible.alioth.debian.org/reproducible.asc | apt-key add -; \
            apt-get update; apt-get upgrade -y 2>/dev/null; ")' \
        ./bash_4.4-4.0~reproducible1.dsc \
        -- \
        schroot unstable-amd64-sbuild

(Yes, this could be a lot nicer to achieve; we're working on it.)


Config File
===========

You can also give options to reprotest via a config file. This is a
time-saving measure similar to ``auto`` presets; the difference is that
these are more suited for local builds that are suited to your personal
purposes. (You may use both presets and config files in the same build.)

The config file takes exactly the same options as the command-line interface,
but with the additional restriction that the section name must match the ones
given in the --help output. Whitespace is allowed if and only if the same
command-line option allows whitespace. Finally, it is not possible to give
positional arguments via this mechanism.

Reprotest by default does not load any config file. You can tell it to load one
with the ``--config-file`` or ``-f`` command line options. If you give it a
directory such as ``.``, it will load ``.reprotestrc`` within that directory.

A sample config file is below::

    [basics]
    verbosity = 1
    variations =
      environment
      build_path
      user_group.available+=builduser:builduser
      fileordering
      home
      kernel
      locales
      exec_path
      time
      timezone
      umask
    store_dir =
      /home/foo/build/reprotest-artifacts

    [diff]
    diffoscope_arg =
      --exclude-directory-metadata
      --debug


Analysing diff output
=====================

Normally when diffoscope compares directories, it also compares the metadata of
files in those directories - file permissions, owners, and so on.

However depending on the circumstance, this filesystem-level metadata may or
may not be intended to be distributed to other systems. For example: for most
distros' package builders, we don't care about the metadata of the resulting
package files; only the file contents will be distributed to other systems. On
the other hand, when running something like `make install`, we *do* care about
the metadata, because this is what will be recreated on another system.

In the first case (where only the file contents will be distributed) you should
pass ``--diffoscope-args=--exclude-directory-metadata`` to reprotest, to tell
diffoscope to ignore the metadata that will not be distributed. Otherwise, you
may get a false-negative result on the reproducibility of your build.

This flag is already set in our presets, in the situations where it is
appropriate to do so.


Varying the user
================

If you also vary fileordering at the same time, each user you use needs to be
in the "fuse" group. Do that by running `usermod -aG fuse $OTHERUSER` as root.

Avoid sudo(1) password prompts
------------------------------

There is currently no good way to do this. The following is a very brittle and
unclean solution. You will have to decide for yourself if it's worth it for
your use-case::

    $ OTHERUSER=(YOUR OTHER USER HERE)
    $ a="[a-zA-Z0-9]"
    $ cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/local-reprotest
    $USER ALL = ($OTHERUSER) NOPASSWD: ALL
    $USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chown -h -R --from=$OTHERUSER $USER /tmp/autopkgtest.$a$a$a$a$a$a/const_build_path/
    $USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chown -h -R --from=$OTHERUSER $USER /tmp/autopkgtest.$a$a$a$a$a$a/build-experiment/
    $USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chown -h -R --from=$OTHERUSER $USER /tmp/autopkgtest.$a$a$a$a$a$a/build-experiment-before-disorderfs/
    $USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chown -h -R --from=$USER $OTHERUSER /tmp/autopkgtest.$a$a$a$a$a$a/const_build_path/
    $USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chown -h -R --from=$USER $OTHERUSER /tmp/autopkgtest.$a$a$a$a$a$a/build-experiment/
    $USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/chown -h -R --from=$USER $OTHERUSER /tmp/autopkgtest.$a$a$a$a$a$a/build-experiment-before-disorderfs/
    EOF

Repeat this for each user you'd like to use. Obviously, don't pick a privileged
user for this purpose, such as root.

(Simplifying the above using wildcards would open up passwordless access to
chown anything on your system, because wildcards here match whitespace. I don't
know what the sudo authors were thinking.)

No, this is really not nice at all - suggestions and patches welcome.


Known bugs
==========

The "time" variation uses **faketime** which *sometimes* causes weird and
hard-to-diagnose problems. In the past, this has included:

- builds taking an infinite amount of time; though this should be fixed in
  recent versions of reprotest.

- builds with implausibly huge differences caused by ./configure scripts
  producing different results with and without faketime. This still affects
  bash and probably certain other packages using autotools.

If you see a difference that you really think should not be there, try passing
``--variations=-time`` to reprotest, and/or check our results on
https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/ which use a different (more reliable)
mechanism to vary the system time.
